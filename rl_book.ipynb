    "### Policy\n",
    "* A **policy** defines the agent's **way of behaving** at a **given time**.\n",
    "* A policy is a **mapping** from perceived **states** of the environment to **actions** to be taken when in those states.\n",
    "  - E.g., a simple function, a lookup table, or a search process. \n",
    "* The policy is the core of an agent (it alone is sufficient to determine behavior).\n",
    "* Policies may be **stochastic**, specifying probabilities for each action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward signal\n",
    "* On each time step, the environment sends to the agent a single number, called the **reward**.\n",
    "* A reward signal defines the **goal** of a RL problem. \n",
    "* The agent's sole objective is to **maximize the total reward** it receives over the long run.\n",
    "* The **reward signal**, thus, defines what are the good and bad events for the agent.\n",
    "* In general, reward signals may be stochastic functions of the state of the environment and the actions taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value function\n",
    "* A **value function** specifies what is good in the **long run**, whereas the reward signal indicates what is good in an **immediate sense**.\n",
    "* The **value of a state** is the **total amount of reward** an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state.\n",
    "* It is values with which we are most concerned when making and evaluating decisions (action choices are made based on value judgments).\n",
    "  - We seek actions that bring about states of highest value, not highest reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "* A **model** is something that mimics the **behavior of the environment** that allows inferences to be made about how the environment will behave.\n",
    "  - E.g., given a state and action, the model might predict the resultant next state and next reward.\n",
    "* Models are used for **planning**, by which we mean any way of deciding on a course of action by considering possible future situations before they are actually experienced.\n",
    "* Methods for solving RL problems that use models and planning are called **model-based** methods, as opposed to simpler **model-free** methods that are explicitly **trial-and-error** learners (viewed as almost the opposite of planning)."

    "* The most important feature distinguishing RL from other types of learning is that it uses training information that **evaluates** the actions taken rather than **instructs** by giving correct actions. \n",
    "  - Purely **evaluative** feedback indicates how good the action taken was, but not whether it was the best or the worst action possible.\n",
    "  - Purely **instructive** feedback indicates the correct action to take, independently of the action actually taken (this kind of feedback is the basis of supervised learning).\n",
